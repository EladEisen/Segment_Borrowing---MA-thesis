# Segment_Borrowing---MA-thesis
This is the code for the statistics and analyses presented in my MA thesis about the typology of phonological segment borrowing.

*Statistics_and_analyses.Rmd* is an R Notebook with the code for most statistics and analyses.
*contact_graph_and_features.ipynb* is a Python Jupyter Notebook with the code for creating the contact graph and the analyses in the feature study.

Notice that in order to run the code you need the SegBo data, which is not fully released yet.
The current public release of SegBo can be accessed at: https://github.com/segbo-db/segbo

My thesis can be accessed at: (TBU)
